# Avaj Launcher

## Introduction
Avaj Launcher is the first project in a series focused on Java, introducing UML class diagrams and object-oriented design patterns. This project is aimed at implementing a minimal aircraft simulation program.

## Project Goals
The main objective is to simulate various aircraft scenarios to identify bottlenecks in airport operations due to weather changes.

## General Instructions
- Utilize Java up to the latest LTS version.
- Avoid external libraries, build tools, or code generators.
- Follow Java package naming conventions for creating your packages.

## Implementation
- Implement the simulation based on the provided class diagram.
- The program takes a scenario file as input and generates a simulation outcome.
- Incorporate basic weather generation and aircraft behavior as specified.
